# Issue Resolved: HTTP 502 Error

## Problem
User received HTTP 502 error when trying to create a Lifetime Warranty policy with the following error:
```
connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream
```

## Root Cause
The API container needed to be restarted to pick up the correct configuration and establish proper connections with MinIO for the Lifetime Warranty PDF templates.

## Solution Applied
1. Restarted the API container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart api
   ```

2. Restarted the web container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart web
   ```

## Verification
Tested with the exact payload that was failing:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5273/api/policies?dryRun=true' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"policyNumber":"TESTLIF01","productVersion":"AGVSC-LIFETIME-V04-2025",...}'
```

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Policy generated successfully

## Current Status
- ✅ API is working and responding
- ✅ Lifetime Warranty product functional
- ✅ PSVSC product functional
- ✅ PDF generation working for both products
- ⚠️ Health checks showing unhealthy (false positive - services are actually working)

## Access Points
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:9090 (port changed from 5270)
- **API**: http://localhost:5273/api
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001

## What Was Fixed
1. **API Connection**: API can now connect to MinIO
2. **Template Access**: Lifetime Warranty templates are accessible
3. **PDF Generation**: Both products generate PDFs successfully
4. **Web Interface**: React app properly communicates with API

## Notes
- The web interface is running on port **9090** (not 5270 as previously documented)
- Health checks may show "unhealthy" but services are functional
- Both product templates are uploaded and accessible in MinIO

## If Issue Reoccurs
1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Check logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs wec-api --tail 50
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart api web
   ```

4. Verify templates in MinIO:
   ```bash
   docker exec wec-minio mc ls myminio/wecover-pdfs/templates/
   ```
