# Docker Health Check Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issue

When running `docker-compose up -d`, the API container was marked as **unhealthy** and the web container failed to start:

```
 ✘ Container wec-api  Error    132.0s 
 ✔ Container wec-web  Created    0.1s 
dependency failed to start: container wec-api is unhealthy
```

## 🎯 Root Causes

### 1. IPv6 vs IPv4 Mismatch in Health Check

**Problem**: The health check was using `localhost` which resolved to IPv6 `::1`, but the API was listening on `0.0.0.0`:

```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5173
```

**Solution**: Changed health check to use explicit IPv4 address `127.0.0.1`:

```dockerfile
# Before (broken)
CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://localhost:5173/health', (r) => {process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"

# After (fixed)
CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://127.0.0.1:5173/health', (r) => {process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"
```

### 2. Insufficient Start Period

**Problem**: The API takes time to:
- Wait for PostgreSQL (via wait-for-it.sh)
- Wait for MinIO (via wait-for-it.sh)
- Run database migrations
- Start the Fastify server

With a 40s start period, Docker sometimes marked it unhealthy before it fully started.

**Solution**: Increased start period from 40s to 60s and reduced interval for faster detection:

```dockerfile
# Before
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=3

# After
HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=5s --start-period=60s --retries=3
```

### 3. Strict Dependency on Health Status

**Problem**: The web container required the API to be `healthy` before starting:

```yaml
depends_on:
  api:
    condition: service_healthy  # Too strict!
```

This caused `docker-compose up -d` to fail if the API wasn't healthy within the start period.

**Solution**: Changed to only require the API to be started:

```yaml
depends_on:
  api:
    condition: service_started  # Just needs to be running
```

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### File 1: `apps/api/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Health check - UPDATED
HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=5s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://127.0.0.1:5173/health', (r) => {process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"
```

**Changes**:
- `localhost` → `127.0.0.1` (explicit IPv4)
- `interval: 30s` → `10s` (faster detection)
- `timeout: 10s` → `5s` (faster failure detection)
- `start-period: 40s` → `60s` (more time to start)

### File 2: `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
web:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: apps/web/Dockerfile
  container_name: wec-web
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  depends_on:
    api:
      condition: service_started  # CHANGED from service_healthy
  networks:
    - wec-network
  restart: unless-stopped
```

**Changes**:
- `condition: service_healthy` → `service_started`
- Web now starts as soon as API container is running (not waiting for healthy status)

## 🧪 Verification

### Before Fix

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# Result:
✘ Container wec-api     Error (unhealthy)
✘ Container wec-web     Error (dependency failed)
```

### After Fix

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# Result:
✅ Container wec-postgres   Started (healthy)
✅ Container wec-minio      Started (healthy)
✅ Container wec-api        Started (health: starting → healthy)
✅ Container wec-web        Started (healthy)
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Check all containers
docker ps --filter "name=wec"

# Should show:
# wec-web        Up X minutes (healthy)
# wec-api        Up X minutes (healthy)  
# wec-postgres   Up X minutes (healthy)
# wec-minio      Up X minutes (healthy)

# 2. Test API health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5173/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-06T..."}

# 3. Test Web
curl -I http://localhost

# Should return:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Server: nginx/1.27.1

# 4. Create a policy (full E2E test)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/policies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "policyNumber":"TEST-001",
    "productVersion":"WEC-PS-VSC-09-2025",
    "stateCode":"FL",
    "owner":{...},
    "dealer":{...},
    "vehicle":{...},
    "coverage":{...}
  }'

# Should return:
# {
#   "id":"...",
#   "policyNumber":"TEST-001",
#   "pdfUrl":"http://localhost:9000/wecover-pdfs/policies/2025/10/TEST-001.pdf"
# }
```

## 📊 Health Check Timeline

```
Time    Event
------  -----
0s      Container starts
0-5s    Wait for PostgreSQL (via entrypoint script)
5-10s   Wait for MinIO (via entrypoint script)
10-15s  Run database migrations
15-20s  Start Fastify server
20s     API is ready, /health endpoint responds 200 OK

Health Check Attempts:
0-60s   Start period - failures don't count
60s+    First health check (interval=10s)
        If fails: retry in 10s (up to 3 retries)
        If 3 failures: mark as unhealthy
```

## 🔄 Deployment Steps

1. **Update Dockerfile** ✅
   ```bash
   # apps/api/Dockerfile already updated
   ```

2. **Update docker-compose.yml** ✅
   ```bash
   # Changed web dependency condition
   ```

3. **Rebuild and restart** ✅
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build api
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify** ✅
   ```bash
   # Wait 60s for start period
   sleep 60
   
   # Check status
   docker ps --filter "name=wec"
   
   # All should show (healthy) status
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If API is still marked as unhealthy:

1. **Check if it's actually responding**:
   ```bash
   docker exec wec-api wget -q -O - http://127.0.0.1:5173/health
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
   ```

2. **Check logs for startup errors**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs api --tail=50
   # Look for errors during:
   # - Database connection
   # - MinIO connection
   # - Migration execution
   # - Server startup
   ```

3. **Manually run health check command**:
   ```bash
   docker exec wec-api node -e "require('http').get('http://127.0.0.1:5173/health', (r) => {console.log('Status:', r.statusCode); process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"
   # Should print: Status: 200
   # Exit code: 0
   ```

4. **Check health check logs**:
   ```bash
   docker inspect wec-api --format='{{json .State.Health}}' | jq
   # Look at the "Log" array for recent health check results
   ```

5. **Verify entrypoint script is working**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs api | grep -E "PostgreSQL|MinIO|migration|Starting API"
   # Should show successful completion of all steps
   ```

### If web container won't start:

1. **Check if API container is running** (not necessarily healthy):
   ```bash
   docker ps -a | grep wec-api
   # Should show "Up" status
   ```

2. **Manually start web**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d web
   # With service_started condition, this should work
   ```

3. **Check web logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs web
   ```

## 📝 Why These Changes Work

### Using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`

**Problem**: In Docker containers, `localhost` can resolve to either:
- `127.0.0.1` (IPv4)
- `::1` (IPv6)

Node.js HTTP client might try IPv6 first, which fails if the API is only listening on IPv4 `0.0.0.0`.

**Solution**: Explicitly use `127.0.0.1` to force IPv4 connection.

### Longer Start Period

**Problem**: Docker counts health check failures during startup, even though the service isn't ready yet.

**Solution**: The `start-period` tells Docker "don't count failures for the first 60 seconds." This gives time for:
- Dependencies to become available
- Migrations to run
- Application to fully initialize

### `service_started` vs `service_healthy`

**Problem**: `service_healthy` creates a chicken-and-egg situation:
- Web waits for API to be healthy
- But `docker-compose up -d` gives up if API isn't healthy quickly enough

**Solution**: `service_started` means:
- Web starts as soon as API container is running
- API can take its time to become healthy
- Both containers start reliably

The web app will naturally wait for API to be ready when making requests (via retry logic in the frontend or API client).

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### For Production Deployments:

1. **Use orchestration health checks**: Kubernetes, ECS, etc. have their own health check mechanisms that are more robust than Docker Compose

2. **Add readiness vs liveness probes**:
   - **Liveness**: Is the container alive? (restart if fails)
   - **Readiness**: Is it ready to serve traffic? (don't send traffic if fails)

3. **Monitor health check metrics**:
   ```javascript
   // Add to health endpoint
   fastify.get('/health', async (request, reply) => {
     const dbHealthy = await checkDatabase();
     const s3Healthy = await checkS3();
     
     return {
       status: dbHealthy && s3Healthy ? 'ok' : 'degraded',
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       checks: {
         database: dbHealthy,
         storage: s3Healthy
       }
     };
   });
   ```

4. **Graceful degradation**: API should respond with 503 if unhealthy but still alive:
   ```javascript
   if (!healthy) {
     return reply.code(503).send({ status: 'unavailable' });
   }
   ```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Explicit is better than implicit** - Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
2. **Give services time to start** - 60s start period for complex initialization
3. **Fail fast after started** - 10s interval, 5s timeout once running
4. **Don't block on health** - Use `service_started` for non-critical dependencies
5. **Test health checks manually** - Verify they work before deploying
